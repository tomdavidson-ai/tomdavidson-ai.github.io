# About me

I research risks from advanced AI at [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/).

Recently, I've focussed on two main themes:
1. AI-enabled human coups: Could a few people use superhuman AI to seize power over a country, or even the world?  
2. AI takeoff speeds: How long might it take to go from broadly human-level AI to significantly superhuman AI?

I've previously worked at [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) and the UK's [AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/). 

I'm on X, [@TomDavidsonX](https://x.com/TomDavidsonX?t=Zl68rhZo3oSvu6VzhI6sLg&s=09).
