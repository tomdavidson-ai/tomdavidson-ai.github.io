# About me

I research risks from advanced AI at [Forethought](https://www.forethought.org/).

Recently, I've focussed on two main themes:
1. AI-enabled human coups: Could a few people use superhuman AI to seize power over a country, or even the world?  
2. AI takeoff speeds: How long will it take to go from broadly human-level AI to superintelligent AI?

I've previously worked at [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) and the UK's [AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/). I'm on the board of [Epoch](https://epoch.ai/).

I'm on X, [@TomDavidsonX](https://x.com/TomDavidsonX?t=Zl68rhZo3oSvu6VzhI6sLg&s=09). I'm also on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AH8HC4wCwzQGoEiVwS6-NHqromhQivJBjmZoXB4QXleZUsrWnPeyvdfozVxQ-Rv4rA6biWCKHR8O-sjWNzaNS-dEToDI9Oz-A3fYi8aAVzpv&user=U7m3WDEAAAAJ).
